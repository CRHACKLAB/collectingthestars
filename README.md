*Collecting the Stars* is a working concept for a simple quiz game designed to teach mathematics and geometry to children in the early grades and increase their awareness of the relevance of environmental issues.

In this demo version, the game randomly chooses one of three sets of 15 questions and presents them to the student, divided into three groups of five. The story presented to the children tells that the hero travels through space to meet three guardians who will give him/her five starflowers each. Starflowers are sources of clean energy that will help save the Earth from self-destruction due to pollution. Each guardian resides on a planet and offers a challenge of five questions about mathematics and geometry. Answering each question correctly guarantees a starflower. Getting a question wrong means starting over from the beginning on that planet.

The software is developed entirely in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, using the [A-FRAME library](https://aframe.io).

The game can be installed simply by copying the contents of this repository into a directory of any web server.
